# Rectangles

## Description
Implement a javascript function that takes an argument array as a parameter and calculates rectangle’s area and perimeter by given **width** and **height**. 
The **width** and **height** will both be passed in the argument array.

## Input
- The array that will be passed as argument will always have exactly 2 elements:
  - The first element -  a floating-point number that will represent the **width** of the rectangle.
  - The second element - another floating-point number that will represent the **height** of the rectangle.

## Output
- Output a single line - the rectangle's **area** and **perimeter**, separated by a **whitespace**.
  - Print the **area** and **perimeter** values with _exactly 2-digits precision_ after the floating point.
- You can use `console.log` to print the results or you can use `return` to return the answer. Both are correct.

## Constraints
- The **width** and **height** will always be valid floating-point numbers.
- Time limit: **0.2s**
- Memory limit: **16MB**
